            <p>
                Should we just do nothing?<br>
                Should we say "To Hell with it all"?<br>
                Should we end the discussion before it even started<br>
                And not pick up the call?<br>
                Should we go pop Xans and stay anesthetized?<br>
                Should we throw up our hands<br>
                Let the talking heads on the television decide this ride?
            </p>
            <p>
                Yeah, we did it<br>
                We didn't<br>
                It's all getting better now, is it?<br>
                It isn't<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm gonna get away with it<br>
                I'm gonna be a winner<br>
                I'm gonna get away-<br>
                'Cause the rich get richer and the sick get sicker<br>
                I'm gonna get away with it<br>
                I'm gonna be a winner<br>
                I'm gonna get away-<br>

            <p>
                I'm gonna pat myself on the back<br>
                'Cause I did the bare minimum<br>
                Where the fuck is my medal?<br>
                Tweetin' from my brand new condominium
            </p>

                My legacy will never burn down<br>
                What you gonna do when it's your turn now?<br>
                Dance with the devil, don't pull her into bed<br>
                Anyone's a hero with a bullet in the head<br>
                I have been around since you were just a child<br>
                You think that you can stop me? Then you are in denial<br>
                I own all of the jury, the judge over the trial<br>
                You walked into a trap, I walk out with a smile
                (Yeah)
            </p>

                I'm gonna get away with it<br>
                I'm gonna be a winner<br>
                I'm gonna get away-<br>
                'Cause the rich get richer and the sick get sicker<br>
                I'm gonna get away with it<br>
